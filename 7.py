#Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 166).
# Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0.
#Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number
# of customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and
# print the value again.
#Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment
# the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any number
# you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a
# day of business.
